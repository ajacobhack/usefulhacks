Hackthebox has online machines to hack, it's the best place to learn by practicing. If you are new I would recommend you learning by doing retired machines following Ippsec videos. HackTheBox academy is the new platform to learn hacking in a more guided way, also a great resource if you want to practice hacking some specific technology!&#x20;
